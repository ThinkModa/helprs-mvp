Best Practices Approach - What We Should Have Done
Phase 1: Foundation (Week 1)
1. Database Schema Design
* Design complete database schema upfront
* Create proper migrations from the start
* Set up RLS policies correctly from day one
* Test database operations before building UI
* Plan for future features and scalability
* Design multi-tenant architecture from beginning
* Create comprehensive data model documentation
2. Authentication & Authorization Strategy
* Use Supabase Auth from the beginning
* Design role-based access control (RBAC) upfront
* Create proper user roles: ADMIN, USER, INSTRUCTOR
* Set up RLS policies that work with Supabase Auth
* Plan user session management
* Design permission system for different user types
* Create user onboarding flow
3. API-First Development
* Design RESTful API endpoints first
* Create API documentation
* Test endpoints with Postman/Insomnia
* Build frontend to consume working APIs
* Define data contracts between frontend and backend
* Create comprehensive API testing suite
* Plan for API versioning and backward compatibility
4. Environment & Deployment Strategy
* Set up proper environment variables from start
* Use different Supabase projects for dev/staging/prod
* Implement proper CI/CD pipeline
* Use feature flags for gradual rollouts
* Create automated testing pipeline
* Set up monitoring and logging
* Plan for disaster recovery
Phase 2: Core Features (Week 2)
1. Admin Dashboard
* Course management system
* User management interface
* Progress tracking dashboard
* Content editing tools
* Analytics and reporting
* System configuration panel
2. User Experience
* Course browsing interface
* Lesson progression system
* Progress tracking display
* Responsive design implementation
* User profile management
* Notification system
Phase 3: Advanced Features (Week 3)
1. Rich Content Editor
* Text formatting capabilities
* Media embedding system
* Link management tools
* Content validation system
* Version control for content
* Preview functionality
2. Third-party Integrations
* Typeform webhook system
* Progress synchronization
* Error handling and retry logic
* Testing suite for integrations
* Monitoring and alerting
* Fallback mechanisms
Specific Issues We Could Have Avoided
Database Issues
* Problem: Duplicate records, conflicting IDs, RLS conflicts
* Solution: Proper schema design with constraints, use UUIDs from start, comprehensive testing
Authentication Issues
* Problem: Custom auth fighting with Supabase RLS
* Solution: Use Supabase Auth + proper RLS policies from day one
Deployment Issues
* Problem: Vercel limits, environment confusion
* Solution: Proper CI/CD setup, environment separation, automated testing
Typeform Integration
* Problem: Complex debugging, wrong lesson IDs
* Solution: Design webhook schema first, test with mock data, comprehensive error handling
Modern Best Practices Checklist
Before Writing Code
* Database schema design complete
* API specification documented
* Authentication strategy planned
* Environment setup configured
* CI/CD pipeline designed
* Security requirements defined
* Performance requirements established
During Development
* Write tests first (TDD approach)
* Use TypeScript from start
* Implement proper error handling
* Add logging and monitoring
* Regular code reviews
* Continuous integration
* Automated testing
Before Deployment
* Security audit completed
* Performance testing done
* User acceptance testing finished
* Documentation complete
* Monitoring configured
* Backup strategy implemented
* Rollback plan ready
Key Lessons Learned
1. Database First: Always design your data model before building UI
1. Authentication Early: Don't build custom auth when platforms provide it
1. API Contracts: Define interfaces before implementation
1. Environment Management: Separate dev/staging/prod from day one
1. Testing Strategy: Write tests as you build, not after
1. Documentation: Document APIs and processes as you go
1. Security First: Plan security from the beginning
1. Performance Planning: Design for scale from the start
